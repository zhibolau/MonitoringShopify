## Todo List
- [x] Integrate restock monitor.
- [x] Multiple brand support on the demands of the people.
- [x] Add Sitemap feature to search sitemap instead of site DOM for finding early links.
- [x] Add Twitter API Settings to Tweet/Send out notifications to timeline.
- [x] Have results return item stock
- [x] Slack bot commands.
- [x] Add Brands via main link.
- [x] Better wiki/docs.
- [ ] Web Interface to modify sites, keywords, etc. (config)
- [x] Garbage collection to prevent heap error after running the monitor over time.
- [ ] Proxy Support
- [ ] Redis Storage for Cache


### What does this thing monitor?
- Newly added items
- Items that become Sold Out
- Items that get restocked
- Items that get removed from stores.
- Early Links.

**Note: If you add a site link to your config you will only be updated on newly dropped items. I'm working on finding a way to add all functionality to people using links instead of built in brands.**

### Brands???
- Palace USA (`palace`)
- AntiSocialSocialClub (`assc`)
- More to come soon inside of the box, but you can simply add a site domain into the `sites` array in your `config.json` file or you can add a sitemap url that ends in `.xml`.

**Note: each site link should have http:// or https:// at the beginning or shopify-monitor won't pick it up.**
